"KOREA" MODULE

Created by MagicalTux

Initially, it was designed to  translate korean folder names from  the data.grf
to english words.  Now it supports  reverse translation and  many languages. It
uses the worldlingo translation service  to get his translations, and  requires
iconv (php extention and libraries) for charset conversions (worldlingo outputs
UTF-8 and we need ISO).
